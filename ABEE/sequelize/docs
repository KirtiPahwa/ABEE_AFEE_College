Sequelize:
It is ORM (object relational mapping).These are libraries, that are used to do all the heaving lifting in
backgroud for us so that we don't focus on database queries and focus more on our node.js code and orms 
convert database queries into easy to use javascript objects. 
Sequelize is orm for sql based databases.
